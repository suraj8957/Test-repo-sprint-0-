# Download and Install Java

---

## Windows Operating System
Here, we will discuss how to download and install Java on a Windows 64-bit Machine and set up the environment to run the first Java program on the command prompt. The process is the same for all Windows i.e. 7, 8, 10, and 11.

### Step 1:
Visit the official Oracle website https://www.oracle.com/in/java/. Click on the "Download Java" icon as shown in the below image.

### Step 2:
Now you can see the latest version is JDK 23 and there are options for Linux, macOS, and Windows. Click on the Windows option and then click the x64 Installer option to download the .exe file for 64-bit Windows OS.
You can simply use this link to download Java for Windows 64 Bit. After successfully downloading JDK 23, now we need to install the Java on our Windows System.
